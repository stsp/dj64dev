</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>wgetstr</STRONG> populates a  user-supplied  string  buffer  <EM>str</EM>  by  repeatedly
       calling  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_getch.3x.html">wgetch(3x)</A></STRONG> with the <EM>win</EM> argument until a line feed or carriage
       return character is input.  The function

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   does not copy the terminating character to <EM>str</EM>;

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   always terminates <EM>str</EM> with a null character;

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   interprets  the   screen's   erase   and   kill   characters   (see
           <STRONG><A HREF="curs_termattrs.3x.html">erasechar(3x)</A></STRONG> and <STRONG><A HREF="curs_termattrs.3x.html">killchar(3x)</A></STRONG>);

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   recognizes  function  keys  only  if  the screen's keypad option is
           enabled (see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_inopts.3x.html">keypad(3x)</A></STRONG>);

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   treats the function keys <STRONG>KEY_LEFT</STRONG> and <STRONG>KEY_BACKSPACE</STRONG> the same as the
           erase character; and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   discards  function key inputs other than those treated as the erase
           character, calling <STRONG><A HREF="curs_beep.3x.html">beep(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       The erase character replaces the character at the  end  of  the  buffer
       with  a  null character, while the kill character does the same for the
       entire buffer.

       If the screen's echo option is enabled (see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_inopts.3x.html">echo(3x)</A></STRONG>), <STRONG>wgetstr</STRONG>  updates
       <EM>win</EM> with <STRONG><A HREF="curs_addch.3x.html">wechochar(3x)</A></STRONG>.  Further,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the  erase  character and its function key synonyms move the cursor
           to the left, and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the kill character returns the cursor to where it was located  when
           <STRONG>wgetstr</STRONG> was called.

       <STRONG>wgetnstr</STRONG>  is  similar,  but  reads  at  most  <EM>n</EM>  characters, aiding the
       application to avoid overrunning the buffer to which  <EM>str</EM>  points.   An
       attempt  to  input  more  than <EM>n</EM> characters (other than the terminating
       line feed or carriage return) is ignored with a beep.

       <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3x)</A></STRONG> describes the variants of these functions.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-RETURN-VALUE">RETURN VALUE</a></H2><PRE>
       These functions return <STRONG>OK</STRONG> on success and <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> on failure.

       In <EM>ncurses</EM>, they return <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> if

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>win</EM> is <STRONG>NULL</STRONG>, or

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   if an internal <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG> call fails.

       Further, in <EM>ncurses</EM>, these functions return <STRONG>KEY_RESIZE</STRONG>  if  a  <STRONG>SIGWINCH</STRONG>
       event interrupts the function.

       Functions  prefixed with "mv" first perform cursor movement and fail if
       the position (<EM>y</EM>, <EM>x</EM>) is outside the window boundaries.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-NOTES">NOTES</a></H2><PRE>
       All of these functions except <STRONG>wgetnstr</STRONG> may be implemented as macros.

       Use of <STRONG>getstr</STRONG>, <STRONG>mvgetstr</STRONG>, <STRONG>mvwgetstr</STRONG>,  or  <STRONG>wgetstr</STRONG>  to  read  input  that
       overruns  the  buffer  pointed to by <EM>str</EM> causes undefined results.  Use
       their <STRONG>n</STRONG>-infixed counterpart functions instead.

       While <STRONG>wgetnstr</STRONG> is conceptually a series of calls  to  <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG>,  it  also
       temporarily  changes  properties  of the <EM>curses</EM> screen to permit simple
       editing of the input buffer.  It saves  the  screen's  state  and  then
       calls  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_inopts.3x.html">nl(3x)</A></STRONG>  and,  if  the  screen  was  in  normal  ("cooked") mode,
       <STRONG><A HREF="curs_inopts.3x.html">cbreak(3x)</A></STRONG>.  Before returning, it  restores  the  saved  screen  state.
       Other   implementations  differ  in  detail,  affecting  which  control
       characters they can accept in the  buffer;  see  section  "PORTABILITY"
       below.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-EXTENSIONS">EXTENSIONS</a></H2><PRE>
       The return value <STRONG>KEY_RESIZE</STRONG> is an <EM>ncurses</EM> extension.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></H2><PRE>
       Applications employing <EM>ncurses</EM> extensions should condition their use on
       the visibility of the <STRONG>NCURSES_VERSION</STRONG> preprocessor macro.

       X/Open Curses Issue 4 describes these functions.  It specifies no error
       conditions  for them, but indicates that <EM>wgetnstr</EM> and its variants read
       "the entire multi-byte sequence associated with a character" and "fail"
       if <EM>n</EM> and <EM>str</EM> together do not describe a buffer "large enough to contain
       any complete characters".   In  <EM>ncurses</EM>,  however,  <EM>wgetch</EM>  reads  only
       single-byte characters, so this scenario does not arise.

       SVr4  <EM>curses</EM>  describes  a  successful return value only as "an integer
       value other than <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>".

       SVr3 and early SVr4 <EM>curses</EM>  implementations  did  not  reject  function
       keys; the SVr4 documentation asserted that, like the screen's erase and
       kill characters, they were

              interpreted, as well as any special keys (such as function keys,
              "home" key, "clear" key, <EM>etc.</EM>)

       without  further  detail.   It  lied.   In  fact, the "character" value
       appended to the string by those implementations was predictable but not
       useful  --  being,  in fact, the low-order eight bits of the key code's
       <STRONG>KEY_</STRONG> constant value.  (The same language, unchanged except for styling,
       survived into X/Open Curses Issue 4, but disappeared from Issue 7.)

       X/Open  Curses Issue 5 (2007) stated that these functions "read at most
       <EM>n</EM> bytes" but did not  state  whether  the  terminating  null  character
       counted  toward  that limit.  X/Open Curses Issue 7 (2009) changed that
       to say they "read at most <EM>n</EM>-1 bytes" to allow for the terminating  null
       character.  As of 2018, some implementations count it, some do not.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>ncurses</EM> 6.1 and <EM>PDCurses</EM> do not count the null character toward the
           limit, while Solaris and NetBSD <EM>curses</EM> do.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Solaris  <EM>xcurses</EM>  offers   both   behaviors:   its   wide-character
           <EM>wgetn</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>wstr</EM>  reserves  room  for a wide null character, but its non-
           wide <EM>wgetnstr</EM> does not consistently count a null  character  toward
           the limit.

       In SVr4 <EM>curses</EM>, a negative <EM>n</EM> tells <EM>wgetnstr</EM> to assume that the caller's
       buffer is large enough to hold the result; that is, the  function  then
       acts  like  <EM>wgetstr</EM>.   X/Open Curses does not mention this behavior (or
       anything  related  to  nonpositive  <EM>n</EM>  values),  however  most   <EM>curses</EM>
       libraries  implement  it.  Most implementations nevertheless enforce an
       upper limit on the count of bytes they write to the destination  buffer
       <EM>str</EM>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   BSD   <EM>curses</EM>   lacked  <EM>wgetnstr</EM>,  and  its  <EM>wgetstr</EM>  wrote  to  <EM>str</EM>
           unboundedly, as did that in SVr2.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>PDCurses</EM>, and SVr3.1, SVr4, and Solaris <EM>curses</EM> limit both functions
           to  writing  256  bytes.  Other System V-based platforms likely use
           the same limit.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Solaris <EM>xcurses</EM> limits the write to <STRONG>LINE_MAX</STRONG> bytes.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   NetBSD 7 <EM>curses</EM> imposes no particular limit on the  length  of  the
           write,  but does validate <EM>n</EM> to ensure that it is greater than zero.
           A comment in NetBSD's source  code  asserts  that  SUSv2  specifies
           this.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>ncurses</EM>  prior  to 6.2 (2020) imposes no limit on the length of the
           write, and treats <EM>wgetnstr</EM>'s <EM>n</EM> parameter as SVr4 <EM>curses</EM> does.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>ncurses</EM> 6.2 uses <STRONG>LINE_MAX</STRONG>  or  a  larger  (system-dependent)  value
           provided  by  <STRONG>sysconf(3)</STRONG>.   If  neither  <STRONG>LINE_MAX</STRONG>  nor  <EM>sysconf</EM>  is
           available, <EM>ncurses</EM>  uses  the  POSIX  minimum  value  for  <STRONG>LINE_MAX</STRONG>
           (2048).   In  either  case,  it reserves a byte for the terminating
           null character.

       Implementations vary in their handling of input control characters.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   While they may enable the screen's echo option, some do not take it
           out  of  raw  mode,  and  may  take  cbreak  mode into account when
           deciding whether to handle echoing within <EM>wgetnstr</EM> or to rely on it
           as a side effect of calling <EM>wgetch</EM>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Originally,  <EM>ncurses</EM>, like its progenitor <EM>pcurses</EM>, had its <EM>wgetnstr</EM>
           call <EM>noraw</EM> and <EM>cbreak</EM> before accepting input.  That may  have  been
           done  to  make  function keys work; it is not necessary with modern
           <EM>ncurses</EM>.

           Since 1995, <EM>ncurses</EM> has provided handlers for <STRONG>SIGINTR</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>SIGQUIT</STRONG>
           events,  which  are typically generated at the keyboard with <STRONG>^C</STRONG> and
           <STRONG>^\</STRONG> respectively.  In cbreak mode, those handlers catch a signal and
           stop   the  program,  whereas  other  implementations  write  those
           characters into the buffer.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Starting with <EM>ncurses</EM> 6.3 (2021), <EM>wgetnstr</EM> preserves  raw  mode  if
           the  screen  was  already  in that state, allowing one to enter the
           characters the terminal interprets as  interrupt  and  quit  events
           into the buffer, for better compatibility with SVr4 <EM>curses</EM>.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-HISTORY">HISTORY</a></H2><PRE>
       4BSD (1980) <EM>curses</EM> introduced <EM>wgetstr</EM> along with its variants.

       SVr3.1 (1987) added <EM>wgetnstr</EM>, but none of its variants.

       X/Open  Curses  Issue  4  (1995)  specified  <EM>getnstr</EM>,  <EM>mvwgetnstr</EM>,  and
       <EM>mvgetnstr</EM>.
