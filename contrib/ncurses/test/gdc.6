.SH NAME
gdc \-
grand digital clock using
.I curses
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gdc
.RB [ \-dns ]
.RB [ \-t
.IB hh : mm : ss\c
]
.RI [ count ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I gdc
uses
.I curses
to display a clock on the terminal.
It constructs the digits from reverse-video blank characters.
If the terminal type supports color,
the digits are drawn in red.
Make the clock stop,
pause,
or resume by typing \*(``q\*('',
\*(``s\*('',
or space,
respectively.
.PP
Given a numeric operand,
the clock
stops after
.I count
seconds.
Normally,
.I gdc
runs \*(``forever\*(''
(at least 2 billion seconds).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-d
uses the terminal's default background color.
.TP
.B \-n
reads input from
.IR \%/dev/null ,
making
.I gdc
ignore the stop and pause commands.
You can still stop it with a terminal interrupt.
.TP
.B \-s
scrolls the digits up as they change.
When running on a fast display,
the program breaks up the scrolling into sub-second redraws,
making the operation appear smooth.
.TP
.BR \-t \ \c
.IB hh : mm : ss
uses the specified time instead of the current time.
