# dj64dev development suite

## what is that?
dj64dev is a development suite that allows to cross-build 64-bit programs
for DOS. It consists of 2 parts: dj64 tool-chain and djdev64 suite.

Also the [host addon](https://github.com/stsp/dj64dev-host-addon)
is available that allows to build the DOS programs for host, using
the DOS emulator to handle the DOS-specific functionality.

### dj64 tool-chain
dj64 is a 64-bit tool-chain that compiles the djgpp-buildable
sources for DOS. There are the following differences with djgpp:
- dj64 produces 64-bit code, djgpp produces 32-bit
- dj64 uses ELF file format, djgpp uses COFF
- dj64 allows to use host's gdb, djgpp uses some old DOS port of gdb
- preliminary unicode support
- mostly complete BSD sockets support
- out-of-the-box ncurses support

The resulting programs run on the emulated DOS environment, with eg
[dosemu2](https://github.com/dosemu2/dosemu2) emulator. In theory the 64-bit
DOS extender can be written to run such programs under the bare-metal
DOS, but the future of DOS is probably in the emulated environments anyway.

### djdev64 suite
djdev64 suite is a set of libraries and headers that are needed to
implement the "DJ64" and "DJ64STUB" DPMI extensions on a DPMI host.<br/>
"DJ64" is an extension that allows the dj64-built programs to access
the 64-bit world.<br/>
"DJ64STUB" is an optional DPMI extension that implements a loader for
dj64-built programs. If "DJ64STUB" extension is missing, you need to have
the full loader inside the program's stub.<br/>
[djstub](https://github.com/stsp/djstub/) project provides both loader-less
and loader-enabled stubs, but the default is the loader-less ministub that
relies on a "DJ64STUB" loader inside DPMI host.

"DJ64" extension requires 2 things from DPMI host:
- put the 64-bit djdev64 runtime into its address space and forward the
  calls from the DOS programs to that runtime
- make the 32-bit calls on 64-bit runtime's requests.

While the second task is rather simple, the first one is not.
If you have an asm-written DPMI server without an ability to talk to
C-written code, then you likely can't have dj64 support in it, as writing
the "DJ64" DPMI extension by hands, without using djdev64-provided
runtime, is too difficult or impossible.

In addition to that, dj64-built programs rely on a few DPMI-1.0 functions.
Namely, shared memory functions
[0xd00](https://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/dpmi/api/310d00.html),
[0xd01](https://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/dpmi/api/310d01.html)
and optionally also "Free Physical Address Mapping" function
[0x801](https://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/dpmi/api/310801.html)
which is used to unmap shared memory regions without actually destroying
them. DPMI host is not required to implement such a specific 0x801
functionality, but the shared memory support is mandatory.

## building and installing
First, you need to install [thunk_gen](https://github.com/stsp/thunk_gen/).
Pre-built packages are available
[for ubuntu](https://code.launchpad.net/~stsp-0/+archive/ubuntu/thunk-gen)
and
[for fedora](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/stsp/dosemu2/).<br/>
Then run `make`.<br/>
For installing run `sudo make install`.<br/>

## installing from pre-built packages
For the ubuntu package please visit
[dj64 ppa](https://code.launchpad.net/~stsp-0/+archive/ubuntu/dj64).
Fedora packages are
[here](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/stsp/dosemu2).

## running pre-built program
The simplest way to get dj64-built programs running is to use
[dosemu2](https://github.com/dosemu2/dosemu2).<br/>
Get the pre-built dosemu2 packages from
[ubuntu ppa](https://code.launchpad.net/~dosemu2/+archive/ubuntu/ppa)
or from
[copr repo](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/stsp/dosemu2)
or build it from
[sources](https://github.com/dosemu2/dosemu2).
dosemu2 uses the dj64-built command.com called
[comcom64](https://github.com/dosemu2/comcom64/).
You can type `ver` to make sure its the right one, in which case you
are already observing the first dj64-built program in the run. :)

## inspecting
You may want to analyze the structure of the dj64-built files to get
the more detailed view of its architecture. You can use `djstubify -i`
for that task (make sure the
[djstub](https://github.com/stsp/djstub/)
package is installed):
```
$ djstubify -i comcom64.exe
dj64 file format
Overlay 0 (i386/ELF DOS payload) at 23440, size 5304
Overlay 1 (x86_64/ELF host payload) at 28744, size 78768
Overlay 2 (x86_64/ELF debug info for comcom64.exe.dbg) at 107512, size 212192
Stub version: 6
Stub flags: 0x0b07
```
As can be seen, the executable consists of 3 overlays. If you use
`djstrip` on it, then only 2 remain. Overlay name is needed for
debugger support, for which we use the GNU debuglink technique.<br/>
Stub flags are used to create the shared memory regions with the
[0xd00](https://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/dpmi/api/310d00.html)
DPMI-1.0 function. They are not documented in a DPMI spec, so their
support by the DPMI host for dj64 is actually optional.

We can compare that structure with the regular djgpp-built executable:
```
$ djstubify -i comcom32.exe
exe/djgpp file format
COFF payload at 2048
```
Nothing interesting here, except that we see djgpp uses COFF format
instead of ELF. But what if we re-stub the old executable?
```
$ djstubify comcom32.exe
$ djstubify -i comcom32.exe
dj64 file format
Overlay 0 (i386/COFF DOS payload) at 23368, size 256000
```
Now this executable is identified as having the dj64 file format, but
of course it still has just 1 COFF overlay. Sorry but the conversion
from COFF to ELF is not happening. :) But our loaders support both
COFF and ELF formats, so dj64/COFF combination is also functional,
albeit never produced by the dj64 tool-chain itself.

## building your own program
Like gcc should be accompanied with binutils in order to produce executables,
dj64 need to be accompanied with
[djstub](https://github.com/stsp/djstub/)
package for the same purpose. That package installs `djstubify`, `djstrip`
and `djlink` binaries that are needed for the final building steps.
So you need to install `djstub` package as a pre-requisite.

Next you should take a look into the provided
[demos](https://github.com/stsp/dj64dev/blob/master/demos)
and probably just choose one as a base for your project.
This is a simplest start.

If OTOH you have an existing project that you wish to port to dj64, then
a few preparations should be made to the source code to make it more
portable:

- Inline asm should be moved to the separate assembler files and called
  as a functions.
- Non-portable `movedata()` function should be replaced with the
  [fmemcpy*()](https://github.com/stsp/dj64dev/blob/master/include/sys/fmemcpy.h)
  set of functions that are provided by dj64. Their use is very similar to
  that of `movedata()`, except that pointers are used instead of selectors.
- Use macros like DATA_PTR() and PTR_DATA() to convert between the DOS
  offsets and 64-bit pointers. Plain type-casts should now be avoided for
  that purpose.
- You need to slightly re-arrange the registration of realmode callbacks:
```
#ifdef DJ64
static unsigned int mouse_regs;
#else
static __dpmi_regs *mouse_regs;
#endif
...
#ifdef DJ64
    mouse_regs = malloc32(sizeof(__dpmi_regs));
#else
    mouse_regs = (__dpmi_regs *) malloc(sizeof(__dpmi_regs));
#endif
    __dpmi_allocate_real_mode_callback(my_mouse_handler, mouse_regs, &newm);
...
    __dpmi_free_real_mode_callback(&newm);
#ifdef DJ64
    free32(mouse_regs);
#else
    free(mouse_regs);
#endif
```
  In this example we see that the second argument of
  `__dpmi_allocate_real_mode_callback()` was changed from the pointer to
  `unsigned int`. The memory is allocated with `malloc32()` call and freed
  with `free32()` call. This requires a few ifdefs if you want that code to
  be also buildable with djgpp.
- Use of int86() should either be changed similar to realmode callbacks,
  or, preferably, replaced with int86x(), as shown
  [here](https://github.com/stsp/dj64dev/blob/master/demos/int86/file.c)
- The file named `glob_asm.h`, like
  [this](https://github.com/dosemu2/comcom64/blob/master/src/glob_asm.h)
  or
  [this](https://github.com/stsp/dj64dev/blob/master/demos/helloasm/glob_asm.h)
  or
  [this](https://github.com/stsp/dj64dev/blob/master/demos/rmcb/glob_asm.h)
  should be created, which lists all the global asm symbols.
- C functions that are called from asm, as well as the asm functions that
  are called from C, should be put to the separate header file, for example
  [this](https://github.com/stsp/dj64dev/blob/master/demos/helloasm/asm.h)
  or
  [this](https://github.com/stsp/dj64dev/blob/master/demos/rmcb/asm.h)
  or
  [this](https://github.com/dosemu2/comcom64/blob/master/src/asm.h)
  .
  In that file you need to define the empty macros with names `ASMCFUNC`
  and `ASMFUNC`, and mark the needed functions with them. `ASMCFUNC` denotes
  the C function called from asm, and `ASMFUNC` denotes the asm function
  called from C. In your `Makefile` you need to write `PDHDR = asm.h`.

Now you need to add a certain thunk files to your project, like
[thunks_a.c](https://github.com/stsp/dj64dev/blob/master/demos/helloasm/thunks_a.c)
,
[thunks_c.c](https://github.com/stsp/dj64dev/blob/master/demos/helloasm/thunks_c.c)
and
[thunks_p.c](https://github.com/stsp/dj64dev/blob/master/demos/helloasm/thunks_p.c)
. As you can see, you don't need to put too many things there, as these
files include the auto-generated stuff. `thunks_a.c` is needed if you
refrence global asm symbols from C. `thunks_c.c` is needed if you call C
functions from asm. `thunks_p.c` is needed if you call to asm from C.

Next, add this to your makefile, verbatim:
```
DJMK = $(shell pkg-config --variable=makeinc dj64)
ifeq ($(wildcard $(DJMK)),)
ifeq ($(filter clean,$(MAKECMDGOALS)),)
$(error dj64 not installed)
endif
clean_dj64:
else
include $(DJMK)
endif
```
to involve dj64 into a build process. Please see
[this makefile](https://github.com/stsp/dj64dev/blob/master/demos/helloasm/makefile)
for an example. Some variables must be exacly of the same name as in an
example file. Those are: `CFLAGS`, `OBJECTS`, `AS_OBJECTS` and `PDHDR`.
Make your `clean` target to depend on `clean_dj64`:
```
clean: clean_dj64
	$(RM) my_app.exe
```
As soon as the dj64's makefile is hooked in, it takes care of compiling
the object files and sets the following variables as the result:
`DJ64_XLIB`, `DJ64_XLDFLAGS` and `LINK`.
You only need to pass those to `djlink` as described below.

Another important variable is `DJ64STATIC`. You can set it to `1`
before hooking in `DJMK` to enable the static linking. You need
to install `dj64-dev-static` package for static linking to work.
This variable can also be automatically set to `1` by `DJMK` hook
itself on the platforms where dj64 does not support dynamic linking
(like on FreeBSD). Static linking produces a much larger executables,
so you may want to strip them with `djstrip`. You can check if the
executable is statically linked, by inspecting `bit 6` in `Stub flags`:
```
$ djstubify -i hello.exe
dj64 file format
Overlay 0 (i386/ELF DOS payload) at 23368, size 30220
Overlay 1 (x86_64/ELF host payload) at 53588, size 186376
Overlay 2 (x86_64/ELF host debug info) at 239964, size 347000
Overlay name: hello.exe
Stub version: 4
Stub flags: 0x0040
```
`0x0040` means that `bit 6` is set, so this is a statically linked executable.
It doesn't need `dj64` package to be installed on a host system, as
the entire runtime is linked in.

Next comes the linking stage where we need to link the dj64-compiled
`DJ64_XLIB` object with `djlink`, to which the variable `LINK` points:
```
STRIP = @true
# or use `STRIP = djstrip` for non-debug build
...
$(TGT): $(DJ64_XLIB)
	$(LINK) -d $@.dbg $^ -o $@ $(DJ64_XLDFLAGS)
	$(STRIP) $@
```
Lets consider this command line, which we get from the above recipe:
```
djlink -d hello.exe.dbg libtmp.so -o hello.exe -f 0x80
```
`-d` option sets the debuglink name.<br/>
`libtmp.so` arg is an expansion of `DJ64_XLIB` variable set by dj64 for us.<br/>
`-o` specifies the output file.<br/>
`-f 0x80` arg is an expansion of `DJ64_XLDFLAGS` variable set by dj64.
It sets `bit 7` in `Stub flags`.<br/>

Please note that you can't freely rearrange the `djlink` arguments.
They should be provided in exactly that order, or omitted.
For example if you don't need to use debugger, then you can just do:
```
$(TGT): $(DJ64_LIB)
	strip $^
	djlink $^ -o $@ $(DJ64_XLDFLAGS)
```
to get an executable without debug info. Note the use of `strip` instead
of `djstrip` in this example. This is because we strip an intermediate
object here, instead of the final executable. But the recommended way is
to use `djstrip <exe_file>` to remove the debug info after linking.
For `djstrip` to work, you need to link with `-d`.
Note that even though some `djlink` args were omitted in the last
example, the order of the present ones didn't change.

Once you managed to link the objects, you get an executable that you can
run under dosemu2.

## building something real
Building [ncurses](https://github.com/stsp/ncurses) is as simple as this:
```
./configure-dj64
make -j 9
```
Directory `test` should be full of tests and demos. But how to run them
if they have no `.exe` extension? One way of solving the problem is to
add the `.exe` extention with the `link2exe.sh` script located in the
same `test` directory:
```
./link2exe.sh firework
```
This creates `firework.exe` from `firework` ELF file, so you can do:
```
dosemu ./firework.exe
```
to watch some firework. Press `q` to quit the demo. But why would you
want to use some script to manually add an `.exe` extension to every
test, which are too many? And the good news is that you don't have to:
```
dosemu -l `pwd`/firework
```
This way we can ask dosemu2 to load the ELF file directly. Of course
you can't run every ELF program in dosemu2 this way. It can only execute
the ELF files produced with dj64dev.

Also you can build
[gopherus fork](https://github.com/stsp/gopherus/).

## what's unsupported
- some crt0 overrides (only `_crt0_startup_flags` override is supported)

## debugging
Debugging with host gdb is supported. The djstub package provides a
`djstrip` binary to strip the debug info from an executable.<br/>
You need to attach gdb to the running instance of dosemu2, or just
run `dosemu -gdb`. Once the dj64-built program is loaded, gdb will
be able to access its symbols.

## so x86-only?
Of course not! This tool-chain is cross-platform. But the resulting
binaries are unfortunately not. If you want to run your program on
x86_64 and aarch64, you need to produce 2 separate executables.
aarch64-built executable will work on aarch64-built dosemu2.

## why would I need that?
Well, maybe you don't. :) If you don't have any djgpp-built project of
yours or you don't want to move it to 64-bits, then you don't need to care
about dj64dev project. It was written for dosemu2, and while I'd be happy
if someone uses it on its own, this wasn't an initial intention.<br/>
Also if your djgpp-buildable project is well-written and uses some
portable libraries like allegro, then most likely you already have the
native 64-bit ports for modern platforms, rather than for DOS. In that
case you also don't need dj64dev.<br/>
Summing it up, dj64dev is a niche project that may not be useful outside
of dosemu2. But I'd like to be wrong on that. :)
